Hello,

Welcome to `The Absolute Beginner's Guide: Windows and Office`

These courses are is designed for those that don’t necessarily have an existing interest in computers.

Maybe computers don’t suit your lifestyle, or you work in an industry where they really aren’t used much, perhaps carpentry, cleaning, plumbing, service, or some other manual field. If that is the case, then this is the course for you.

So, what exactly is covered in these courses?

Well, first, we will talk about the different types of PCs, Desktops, and Laptops, and cover the main differences between them.

Next, we will dive into `Microsoft Office`, discussing how to purchase `Office` and how to launch the applications that come with it.

Then we will talk about each of the main Office Applications, `Word`, `PowerPoint`, and `Excel`, reviewing what each one does, why you would want to use it, and explain the most common tasks that you will use each one for.

This is by no means a comprehensive course meant to take you from zero to hero in each of these topics, but rather, it’s meant to give you a working knowledge of these programs, so you can feel confident when you need to use them.

At the end of each section, you will work on a class project, showing that you have understood the main points of each lesson.

You will turn this in at the end of the course, but feel free to keep in touch in the discussions, as I will strive to read each comment made, and answer each question.

That about wraps it up for the introduction, so stay tuned, and I’ll see you in the next video.
