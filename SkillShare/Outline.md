# The Absolute Beginner's Guide: Windows and Office

> By Zachery Hysong

This was originally going to be a single course meant for a company like Udemy that has more longform courses.
Since this is going to be on Skillshare instead, it is going to be split up into multiple shorter courses.

## Series Overview

This Series is meant for seniors or really anyone who is not very familiar with computers.  

People who grow up with “blue collar” jobs are not trained on how to use computers at all, foregoing computer classes for more physical classes for Welding, Carpentry, or other trade stills.  

This Series is is geared toward those people, and is meant as an absolute beginners course, teaching topics from the basics of computer hardware to basic operations of Windows (XP - 10, as many schools and testing centers use older, cheaper hardware), and Microsoft Office (2007-365). It is not going to go into advanced topics like programming macros in Excel, but will offer enough to help anyone gain a working knowledge of the basics, allowing them to become more confident in their abilities to further progress in their trade.  

*No Prior knowledge of computers or Microsoft Office is required.*

> I do not currently possess a MacBook or any other Mac Device, so I cannot cover those topics, but they are planned for the future, and the interface for OS X Office is pretty close, but not a 100% match.
