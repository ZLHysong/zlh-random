# Daily Tasks and Notes

> This file will contain what I was assigned each day (Should match the Glo Board), and what I accomplished.
> I want to use this alongside the Glo Board to better track each day, so I don't have to rely on the board history to remember what I did.

### Daily Notes

#### Terms and Conditions Button 

This link requires a JS file that does not play nice with the other files. No matter where I add it to the page, something else breaks.
My suggestion is to change the link from whatever it is to a new Article or Popup, and copy the content from the live site into it.

*Mike is taking over this task for a while to see what he can figure out. Temporarily removing from my list.*

#### Confirmation email should match `live` site

Both emails contain LKW content, but the 2018 one does differ. We will need to find the variable that it uses on the live site and replace the 2018 version with that content.
