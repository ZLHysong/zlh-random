# Daily Tasks

> This file will contain what I was assigned each day (Should match the Glo Board), and what I accomplished.
> I want to use this alongside the Glo Board to better track each day, so I don't have to rely on the board history to remember what I did.

This link requires a JS file that does not play nice with the other files. No matter where I add it to the page, something else breaks.

My suggestion is to change the link from whatever it is to a new Article or Popup, and copy the content from the live site into it.
